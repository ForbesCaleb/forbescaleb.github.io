## About Me

I am a final-year Information Technology student with a strong interest in software development, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. I have experience developing applications using C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, SQL databases, and Microsoft Azure.

Through my academic projects, I have built full-stack web applications, console applications, and cloud-integrated systems that focus on practical problem solving and clean system design.

I have worked on projects such as an Event Booking System using ASP.NET Core MVC and Azure services, as well as a C# console-based chatbot with structured logic and validation.

I am passionate about continuously improving my technical skills and learning new technologies. My long-term goal is to become a professional software developer and eventually build my own technology-driven business.
